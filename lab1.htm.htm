  <p>Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Joseph. I am a third year Information Technology & Management major. I've spent my entire life in Chicago.</p>
  <p>I have some coding experience already. Mainly with Python and Java 7/8. This past summer I spent time interning at Northwestern University where I was coding android apps using DART.</p>
  <p>I am taking this course as a requirement for my major, but I am also quite interested on how to code for websites using html. </p>
